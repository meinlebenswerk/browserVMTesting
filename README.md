# VM Security testing
Fairly incomplete security testing of [vm-browserify](https://github.com/browserify/vm-browserify) and [vm-browser](https://github.com/snanovskyi/vm-browser).
This should not be regarded as a complete test, as it was done simply to prove a point :)
Maybe (surely) I missed something - If yes, please submit a pull request or shoot me a message!

The test-runner is based on Vue.js and runs directly in your browser, you can check out the live-demo [here](https://meinlebenswerk.github.io/browserVMTesting/).

### Running locally
If you want to run the project locally, from source, clone this repo via:
`https://github.com/meinlebenswerk/browserVMTesting.git`
And then install the dependencies with npm:
`npm i`
after that, you're ready to run 
`npm run serve`
and the development server should start up.
